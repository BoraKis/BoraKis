### Hi there. I'm Bora :sunglasses: :computer:
![bora](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47301584/88222120-29eba780-cc6e-11ea-839e-139fba2565c4.jpg)
I was born on October 4, 1998 in Ankara. After completing my primary and high school education here, I was entitled to enter the Department of Biomedical Engineering at DÃ¼zce University in 2016 and still continue my education life. I will complete my undergraduate period in June 2020. I am particularly interested in machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, digital signal processing and image processing.
