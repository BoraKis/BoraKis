### Hi there. I'm Bora :sunglasses: :computer:

I was born on October 4, 1998 in Ankara. After completing my primary and high school education here, I was entitled to enter the Department of Biomedical Engineering in DÃ¼zce University in 2016 and still continue my education life. I will complete my undergraduate period in June 2020. I am particularly interested in machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, digital signal processing and image processing.
